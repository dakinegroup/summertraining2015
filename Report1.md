##Basic Terminology
1. **EPROM** - Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory.  
                It is erased by exposing to strong UV light source.  
                It is Non Volatile.  
                It was used in microcontrollers like _Itel 8048_ and _C versions of PIC Microcontrollers_.

2. **EEPROM** - Electrically Erasable Programmable ROM.  
It is used to store small amount of data.  
While _EPROM_ is removed for erasing and programming, _EEPROM_ can be erased and programmed by applying **special programming signals.**
