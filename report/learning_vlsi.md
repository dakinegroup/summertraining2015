#Visit to ...
On 13th June, 2015 we had visited ..... where we had small discussion and introduction to VLSI and its various opportunities in industry. We also discussed about the processors we come across in our daily life.    
If we see our past, nearly 20 years ago and compare it with present we come to know that number of transiters in an integrated circuit has increased and it will still increase in near future. If we talk about clock speed of a processor then it has also increased but in future there will be a point when the the clock speed will start decreasing due to increase in capacitive and inductive effects.
##Introduction to VLSI
**VLSI** - Very Large Scale Integration. Many ICs had a limited funtion to perform. VLSI overcame it. It is the process of creating an IC by combining thousands of transistors into a single chip.  

**HDL** - Hardware Descriptive Language. It is the language used to program the structure, design and operation of electronic circuits. It gives description of an electronic circuit that allows for analysis, simulation and testing of that circuit.  

**Verilog** - It is a HDL used to model electronic systems. It is useed for design and verification of digital circuits at RTL.

**RTL**-Register Transfer Level. It is a design abstraction which models a  synchronous digital circuit in terms of the flow of digital signals between hardware registers, and the logical operations performed on those signals.  
It focuses on describing how the signal will flow in the circuit. It is used in logic design phase on IC design cycle.

**EAD or ECAD** - Electronic Design Automation. It is software tools for designing PCB and ICs.

##Processor

**RISC** - Reduced Instruction Set Computing. 
 * Simplified instructions are used in RISC.  
 * It provides high performance.  
 * It uses fewer microprocessor cycles per instruction.
 * RISC have separate intructions of I/O and data processing.
 * ARM, Atmel AVR uses RICS.

**CISC** - Complex instruction set computing.
 * Complex instructions are used in CISC.
 * Single instruction can execute low level operation such as load from memory set.
 * Intel x86 processors uses CISC.

In RISC the amount of work done by a instruction is reduced as compared to CISC in which execution of a single instruction take many memory cycles. RICS uses less energy than CISC chips. Therefore these are used in mobile phones.

**Multicore Processor** - It is a single compnent with two or more processing units.  
In multicore they can run multiple instructions at same time which increases overall speed programs managable to parallel computing.  
I consumes less energy and give high performance.

**Multithreading** - 
It is the ability of a CPU or a single core in a multicore processor to execute multiple processes.  
It aims to increase utilization of a ssingle core by using instruction level parallelism.

Multicore processors have replaced multithreading technique and they are also used in mobile phones. But Intel still uses multithreadin in Multicore processors.
