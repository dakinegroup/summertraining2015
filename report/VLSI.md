#Visit to ...
On 13th June, 2015 we had visited ..... where we had small discussion and introduction to VLSI and its various opportunities in industry. We also discussed about the processors we come across in our daily life.    
If we see our past, nearly 20 years ago and compare it with present we come to know that number of transiters in an integrated circuit has increased and it will still increase in near future. If we talk about clock speed of a processor then it has also increased but in future there will be a point when the the clock speed will start decreasing due to increase in capacitive and inductive effects.
##Introduction to VLSI
**VLSI** - Very Large Scale Integration. Many ICs had a limited funtion to perform. VLSI overcame it. It is the process of creating an IC by combining thousands of transistors into a single chip.  

**HDL** - Hardware Descriptive Language. It is the language used to program the structure, design and operation of electronic circuits. It gives description of an electronic circuit that allows for analysis, simulation and testing of that circuit.  

**Verilog** -
