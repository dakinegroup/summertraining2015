#Training Report (Summer 2015, Abhinav Ghai)

##Organization Overview

###About Organization

da Kine Technologies pvt. ltd. (DKTPL), started in 2010, was founded by 3 technology people. It started with an idea to create a product in education which can help connect tutors to remote students. Later it ventured into various other projects and products in the domain of automation - ERP, CRM and System Solutions.

###Technologies

DKTPL current focus area is internet technologies, though the abilities cover quite a vast area in terms of creating a full-fledged solution with knowledge of electronics and software. Currently, in their projects, they use different frameworks like PhoneGap, Ionic, Android - SDK, NodeJs, AngularJs and several other frameworks from PHP to create solutions for small businesses in managing their resources, delivering services to their end customers.

###Products

DKTPL is creating a product, ComLiive, that is aimed at enabling access of small players to Android and iOS market places, with their own shops setup.

DKTPL has also a product in delivering services online for dieticians to their customers.

DKTPL has provided consultancy in creating similar platforms to other startups.

##Synopsis of Training
6 weeks of training at DKT enabled exposure to mix of software and hardware practical knowledge. During this period, there were couple of visits to Industries to see use of electronics and software. Electronics and software are interdependent disciplines and together serve several industries, via automation, recording, analysis etc. Electronics enables the capturing, access to the real world, while software is much bigger pie as it explores various possibilities of application of data and controls.

Knowledge in C-Language and digital electronics was heavily used and further strengthened while trying to implement new things. Logical reasoning and conceptualising / doing things on paper is key to design and solving problems using software and hardware.

Electronics advances in low powered devices, smaller footprints and revolution in addressability is enabling to dumb physical devices like watches, shoes as intelligent devices. Software is able to reach and collect data from remotest possible items that human being may be using. This is generating exabytes of data and hence throwing lot of information which is being analysed through advanced statistical techniques using software to make predictions and optimizations in operations.

Overall, world of software and hardware, when fused together to open new world of possibilities is quite exciting. For me it is just a beginning.
