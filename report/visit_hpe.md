#Industrial Visit
On May 3, 2015 we had  an industrial visit at "Hindustan Pumps Pvt. Ltd." ,Karnal.
##About
Hindustan Pumps Pvt Ltd was established in 1975 . It achieved the certification of ISO 9001:1994  on 1999. Company has been manufacturing pump and motors of different types and is using a single brand name of 'Hindustan' since beginning. In the year 2003 company launched its second brand 'Uttam' as a marketing strategy for opening new market avenues. Company has acclaimed reputation of high standard performance with excellent after-sale-service.

##Purpose of Visit
The main purpose of our visit was to see the **application of automation and control systems in the industry**.

##Products
Hindustan Pumps manufactures variety of pumps. Some of the products are:-
  1. Borewell Submersible Pumps - These are used in agriculture, industries etc.
  2. Monoblock Pumps - These find their application in Mines , Dam sites etc.
  3. Indusction Motors - These are for domestic puposes.
  4. Sewerage Pumps - These are used in drainiage and sewerage pumping systems.

##Processes seen in Pump Manufacture
  1. Drilling - This process was done by VMC machines.
  2. Cutting - This process was done in CNC machines. Manual Lathe machines were also there.
  3. Winding - For bigger pumps winding was done manually as they require less number of turns which can be easily counted. But for small motors various machines were there for widing.
  4. Assembling
  5. Compressing
  6. Balancing - Rods were fitted horizontally in balancing machine and through meter they were seeing at which angle the weight on the rod is more. At that point they drilled that rod to reduce the weight.
  7. Casting and Moulding
  8. Painiting
  9. Drying - For fast drying of paint and preventing it from dust the pumps were put in oven.
  10. Testing speed , torque.


## Assembly Line Working
**TODO** Recall how windings were repeatedly done by same person. Instructions being captured on walls for reminding the steps

**TODO** Automation for drilling / cutting / rotation in single machine
CNC and VMC machines , these machines are controlled by computer. The programs produce a computer file that is interpreted to extract the commands needed to operate a particular machine via a post processor, and then loaded into the CNC machines for working.

**TODO** Proximity of subsequent stages of operations so that intermediate goods can be moved easily

**TODO** Think if there is something that can be an improvement in their working.

**TODO** Measurement meters used at different places. Screw gauge used to measure internal/external diameter, weight balancing, counter on winding

**TODO** purpose of oven and painting

**TODO** what happens to the waste / rejections?

**NOTE** While you capture above information, your focus should be more towards process in practice, that helps an organization achieve maximum efficiency.

## Load testing of submersible pumps
**TODO** What are the various sensors put to measure mechanical parameters, electrical characteristics?
**TODO** Interface for recording this data
**TODO** How is this data used?
**TODO** Sampling - IS specifications? -- read about it


##Process of process improvement
**TODO** This is related to the discussion we had. A brief note is given below.
HPE maintains information on defects that arise out of inspection during the production and material incoming. In latter case, this defect is raised back to the supplier and asked for the corrective action and preventive action plans. In-Process inspection, is done by quality inspector, daily. Observations are recorded in a register, which captures action plan to correct. One example we observed was related to mismatch in specification v/s part produced. Root Cause captured was related to the machine setting. Another case was related to inconsistent material supplied by vendor. It was discovered through this process of causal analysis, that measurement gauges were to be used and calibrated to eliminate the material rejection.

During discussion, it was stressed upon that HPE wants to develop Toyota Culture, where the worker (producer) himself tries to identify defects and eliminates the fault in process. Their goal is achieve zero-defect manufacturing.

In their endeavour to achieve best quality of output, they have put in place process automation / traceability. ERP system is being put in place to log such defects and analysed for trend.

##Conclusion


The part which is appreciable about this firm is that maximum work of production of pumps is done in the factory itself. There is no outsourcing. At the startup to reduce the cost various things like racks for stores , lifts and several transporting machines were made in the factory itself. This plant needs huge amount of cooperation , hardwork and sincereness among the workers and we saw it at much greater extent than we expected, which is also appreciable.
