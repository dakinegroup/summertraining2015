###Processes seen in Pump Manufacture
  1. Drilling - This process was done by VMC machines.
  2. Cutting - This process was done in CNC machines. Manual Lathe machines were also there.
  3. Winding - For bigger pumps winding was done manually as they require less number of turns which can be easily counted. But for small motors various machines were there for widing.
  4. Assembling
  5. Compressing
  6. Balancing - Rods were fitted horizontally in balancing machine and through meter they were seeing at which angle the weight on the rod is more. At that point they drilled that rod to reduce the weight.
  7. Casting and Moulding
  8. Painiting
  9. Drying - For fast drying of paint and preventing it from dust the pumps were put in oven.

###ABC
CNC and VMC machines , these machines are controlled my computer. The programs produce a computer file that is interpreted to extract the commands needed to operate a particular machine via a post processor, and then loaded into the CNC machines for working.

The part which is appreciable about this firm is that maximum work of production of pumps is done in the factory itself. There is no outsourcing. At the startup to reduce the cost various things like racks for stores , lifts and several transporting machines were made in the factory itself. This plant needs huge amount of cooperation , hardwork and sincereness among the workers and we saw it at much greater extent than we expected, ehich is also appreciable.
