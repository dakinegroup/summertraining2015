### Object Oriented Design

#### Objects and Classes
**Objects** - These are the things with independent runtime existance. These are entities in object oriented systems.  
At run time objects interact with each other by sending messages.  
**Class** - Class is a collection of objects of same type.  
For example - there are fruits in a basket like banana, orange and apple. In this example fruit is a class and banana , orange and apple are its objects.
#### Inheritance 
It is the property in oop in which sub classes  inherit or acquire the properties of its main class.

#### Polymorphism
Means the ability to take more than on form.  
Consider a situation. There is a class names Area. It has three objects circle, square & triangle with functions area(circle), area(square) & area(triangle) respectively. But the operation area is different for all three figures. So polymorphism will be helpful in objects with different internal functions to show same external functions. 

#### Operator Overloading
It is the process in which a operator is asked to do different tast at different instances.  
For example - operation of addition adds two integers. But wern this operator is used in strings it forms a new string by concatenation.
